## Introduction

This project was made to showcase my data analysis skills. The project consists of small projects using data cleaning, data wrangling, and data interpretation skills. In this project I used Python, SQL, R, and Tableau.

## Projects

- **COVID-19 Project**: This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL. It includes data cleaning, querying, and visualization to understand the impact and trends of the pandemic.
